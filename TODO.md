MVP:

-   summarize thread/channel/discussion
-   send email to specified recipient(s)
    -   open modal to edit email before sending.
-   search emails by date range and keywords
-   send in-channel as message and/or extract attachment and upload to channel
-   report on daily email statistics

MORE FUN:

-   more email providers
-   more functions like change label etc.
-   user feedback loop: if execution context is out of context, the system can log this feedback for future improvements.
-   report daily email stats, new emails etc. (cron job maybe?)
